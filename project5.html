                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
The project aims to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to forecast wind power generation based on real-time weather data. Wind power is one of the fastest-growing sources of renewable energy, and accurately predicting wind energy output is crucial for optimizing energy grid operations, balancing supply and demand, and maximizing efficiency.

This project uses real-time meteorological data from OpenWeatherMap and incorporates cutting-edge time series forecasting models to predict wind speeds, which are a critical factor in determining wind power generation. By utilizing lag features and historical weather patterns, the model can anticipate future wind speeds and help energy planners better understand wind power output.                </p>

                <h3>Keey Features</h3>
                <p>
Real-Time Weather Data Collection:
A Python-powered data collection system fetches live weather data from OpenWeatherMap, focusing on factors such as wind speed, temperature, humidity, and pressure. This system is designed to gather data at regular intervals, ensuring an up-to-date and comprehensive dataset that serves as the foundation for predictive modeling.

Automated Data Logging and Organization:
Weather data is automatically appended to a structured CSV file in real-time, with each new data entry timestamped. This ensures that even if the weather data doesn't change significantly, each data point is captured and stored for analysis. This ensures a reliable dataset for model training.

Feature Engineering Using Historical Weather Data:
The project incorporates feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy. One of the key features is the creation of lag features, where the wind speeds from previous time intervals (e.g., 1 hour ago, 2 hours ago) are used as predictors for future wind speeds. These lag features allow the model to learn temporal patterns and trends in the data, making the predictions more robust and context-aware.

Machine Learning Model Training:
The project employs a linear regression model or similar machine learning algorithm to predict wind speeds based on historical weather data. The model is trained using the collected data and validated using a separate test set to assess its accuracy. The model leverages the lag features to generate more accurate predictions for wind speeds at future intervals, which are critical for estimating wind energy output.

Evaluation and Metrics:
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), which quantifies how closely the predicted wind speeds match the actual observed data. The lower the error, the more accurate the model, allowing for fine-tuning and improvements in future iterations.

Forecasting Wind Power Generation:
By predicting future wind speeds, the project simulates real-world energy forecasting scenarios. Energy companies and grid operators could theoretically use this model to anticipate wind energy production, make informed decisions on energy storage, and manage supply-demand dynamics in real-time.
