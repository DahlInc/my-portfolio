                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    This project aims to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to forecast wind power generation based on real-time weather data. 
                    Wind power is one of the fastest-growing sources of renewable energy, and accurately predicting wind energy output is crucial for optimizing energy grid operations, 
                    balancing supply and demand, and maximizing efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using real-time meteorological data from OpenWeatherMap and incorporating advanced time series forecasting models, this project predicts wind speeds, a critical factor in 
                    determining wind power generation. The model utilizes lag features and historical weather patterns, anticipating future wind speeds to help energy planners better understand 
                    and manage wind power output.

            <section class="project-section">
                <h3>Key Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Real-Time Weather Data Collection:</strong> A Python-powered system fetches live weather data from OpenWeatherMap, focusing on wind speed, temperature, humidity, and pressure. Data is gathered at regular intervals, providing a comprehensive dataset for predictive modeling.</li>

                    <li><strong>Automated Data Logging and Organization:</strong> Weather data is automatically appended to a CSV file, with each new entry timestamped. This structured logging ensures a growing, reliable dataset for training the machine learning model.</li>

                    <li><strong>Feature Engineering Using Historical Weather Data:</strong> The project generates lag features (e.g., wind speeds from 1 or 2 hours ago) to improve prediction accuracy, allowing the model to learn temporal patterns in the data.</li>

                    <li><strong>Machine Learning Model Training:</strong> A linear regression model (or similar) is trained using the collected data, validated with a test set, and used to predict future wind speeds. The model leverages lag features for more accurate predictions.</li>

                    <li><strong>Evaluation and Metrics:</strong> Model performance is measured using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), quantifying how closely the predictions match the actual data. Lower errors indicate a more accurate model, providing insights for future improvements.</li>

                    <li><strong>Forecasting Wind Power Generation:</strong> By predicting future wind speeds, the project simulates real-world energy forecasting scenarios, allowing energy companies and grid operators to anticipate wind energy production and make informed decisions on energy storage and grid management.</li>
                </ul>
