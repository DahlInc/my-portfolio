                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
In this project, I utilized Power BI to perform in-depth financial analysis on stock market data, focusing on key metrics such as market capitalization, volatility, price momentum, and P/E ratios. The goal was to provide investors with a comprehensive view of market trends and company performance, enabling data-driven decisions for both short-term trading and long-term investments. By visualizing these metrics, the analysis offers clear insights into risk, timing, and valuation in the stock market                </p>
